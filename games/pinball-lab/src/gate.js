// compared to anything (LAB-11's P0-1, code review 20260902T130928Z). One pure implementation
// here, reused by every stage runner — the impure part (how each runner reports/exits on
// failure) stays with the caller, matching the style each runner already used for its other
// gates (§2.4a's sd-floor / arena-on-target checks).
